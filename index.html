<h2>WEB</h2>
<P>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents
  and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/),
  which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2]
  The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
  may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published
  by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet,
  which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two decades and upon whose technologies the Web is built.
English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser
in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.[3][4] The browser was released outside CERN
to other research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the general public in August 1991.</P>
